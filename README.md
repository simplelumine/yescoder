Your essential companion for YesCode in VS Code. Monitor your balance and manage providers seamlessly from the status bar.

## Features

-   **One-Click CLI Setup**: Quickly get setup commands for YesCode's CLIs (Gemini, Codex, Claude). The helper intelligently detects your OS and team status to provide the right command, which can be executed automatically in the terminal or copied to the clipboard.
-   **Balance Monitoring:** Keep an eye on your most critical balance (Team, Subscription, or PayGo) directly in the status bar.
-   **Provider Management:** Switch your default and alternative providers for both your user account and your team account without ever leaving the editor.
-   **Seamless Account Support:** Works with all types of YesCode accounts, including production and special/testing accounts, by automatically connecting to the correct backend services.
-   **Centralized Command Menu:** A single click on the status bar opens a menu with all core extension commands.
-   **Smart Display Modes:** Automatically detects the most relevant balance to display, with a manual override to lock it to a specific mode.
-   **Detailed Tooltips:** Hover over the status bar for a mini-dashboard with a full breakdown of your current balance.
-   **Secure API Key Storage:** Uses VS Code's native `SecretStorage` to keep your API key safe.
-   **Automatic Refresh:** Keeps your balance up-to-date by automatically refreshing every minute.

## Setup

1.  Install the extension from the VS Code Marketplace.
2.  Click the "YesCode: Loading..." item in the status bar to open the menu.
3.  Select `Set API Key` and enter your YesCode API key when prompted. The extension will automatically detect the correct environment.
4.  Your balance and provider management features are now active.

## Commands

-   **`YesCode: One-Click CLI Setup...`**: Opens the CLI setup helper.
-   **`YesCode: Show Menu`**: Opens the main command menu from the status bar.
-   **`YesCode: Refresh Balance`**: Manually refreshes your balance information.
-   **`YesCode: Switch Display Mode`**: Manually selects which balance to display.
-   **`YesCode: Switch Vendor`**: Opens the provider management interface. (Not available for special/testing accounts).
-   **`YesCode: Set API Key`**: Stores your API key securely.

## Known Issues

-   **API Data Dependency:** The extension is built to be resilient against missing optional data from the YesCode API. However, in the rare event that the API returns a fundamentally malformed data object (e.g., a provider object missing a required field like `display_name`), the extension may encounter an error. A refresh (`YesCode: Refresh Balance`) will typically resolve this once the API is stable.

## Project Architecture

This extension is built with a clean, feature-driven architecture:

-   `src/extension.ts`: The main activation file that orchestrates the different features.
-   `src/core/`: Contains the core logic for command registration and status bar creation.
-   `src/monitor/`: All logic for the balance monitoring feature.
-   `src/providers/`: All logic for the provider management feature.
-   `src/api.ts`: Manages all API calls to YesCode, including environment detection.
-   `src/types.ts`: Defines all shared data structures.
